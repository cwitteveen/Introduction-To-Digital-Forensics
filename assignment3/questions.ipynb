    "<b>4. What are the characteristics of the attack (aka fingerprint)?  \n",
    "    Remember: the fingerprint are the characteristics that most repeats targeting a single destination IP. Traffic FROM the victim to the IP addresses in the network trace are NOT part of the attack. Tip: isolate 1 source and 1 destination IP and see if the same pattern applies to the other source IP addresses.</b>\n",
